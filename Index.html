    My IT Profile</h1>


   <h2 id="myHeader">Some information about me</h2>


     <img src="Hoang.png" width="200px" Right= "20px" id=img3>

     <p>Hello everyone! My name is <b> Bui Hoang </b>, My student ID is <b>S3818202 </b> and my Gmail is <b>s3818202@rmit.edu.vn</b>. I was born on February 4th, 1998, and I come from Hanoi. Right now I am an RMIT student in Information Technology major. I graduated from Ha Giang Gifted High School (Mathematics specialized class) in June 2016 with the scoring of 8.0. I passed the entrance examination of Vietnam National University- Hanoi University of Science and I have studied in VNU for 2 years in Mathematics major. Therefore, realizing that I do not like to study Mathematics, I have changed to study in RMIT since July 2019. I can speak Vietnamese as my local language and English. As every younger in Vietnamese, I love to spend time to play video games with my friend in my free time, I also love to play soccer.</p>

     <h2 id="myHeader">My Interest in IT</h2>

     <p>I have my first PC when I was 5, so I was approached to a computer from very early. But for the first time, all my views with a computer just no more than a machine for playing video games. I love to play videogame from I was a child, in that time, my dream was making a game that everyone loves to play, this is one of my reasons for choosing IT as my major. Next, I started to search for information about IT and find out that IT is more than just about a video game. IT appears in all parts of human life: business, architecture, traffic, entertainment, etc. Then, the more information I knew in IT, the more interesting in this major increased. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIwLWfaAg-8&t=404s"> The talk show of Elon Musk in TED </a>  about The future we’re building is the last factor that helps me to choose this major. He is a good example of successful people from technology majors, then the Imagine he draws about what technology can improve people's lives in the future make me excited and want to be an IT worker. </p>

     <h2 id="myHeader">Personal Profile </h2>

     <p> The results of my online Myers-Brigg test in 16personalities.com is <b> a Logician </b>. <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-careers"> LINK</a> </p>

      <img src="Logician.png" alt="" id=img1>
     <p> The results of my online learning style test in EducationPlanner.org is <b> a visual learner </b>. <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=5&V=12&T=3">LINK</a> </p>

     <img src="learning.png" alt="" id=img1>
     <p> The results of my online creativity test in mindtools.com is <b> 62/80 </b>  </p>

     <img src="creativity.png" alt="" id=img1>
     <p> The results of these tests have a critical meaning for me. These ideas help me more understand about myself:  who I am, my weakness and my strength. Furthermore, I can know my best way of learning through the learning style test. Moreover, the results support me in choosing IT as my job by showing that I have enough abilities to work in an IT major. I always wonder if I choose the right job and do me suitable to be an IT worker.  A big fear appears insight me that I cannot go far from this way because I don’t have any talent. The results of these tests bellow show to me that I am suitable to work in the job I love with creativity and inventiveness. </p>

     <p> I believe these results will influence my behavior a lot while working in a team. I will try to do all my strengths and improve my weakness. For instance, the IT industry requires all employees have to work as a team, so people who are passive and selfish are hard to work in this major. By knowing I am introverted, I will try to be sociable, active to talk and be confident to show my idea with other members of a team. I will make a decision based on notice thinking more than just a feeling. I will be an enthusiastic teammate who will help other members.  </p>

     <p> From these results I got from these test, right now while forming in a team I believe that I can become a good listener and a good member who usually give ideas for solving problems. </p>
