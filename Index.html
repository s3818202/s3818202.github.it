    </div>
     Hello everyone! My name is <b> Bui Hoang</b>, my student ID is <b>S3818202</b> and my Gmail is <b>s3818202@rmit.edu.vn</b>. I was born on February 4th, 1998, and I come from Hanoi. Right now, I am a RMIT student in Information Technology major. I graduated from Ha Giang Gifted High School (Mathematics specialized class) in June 2016 with the scoring of 8.0. I passed the entrance examination of Vietnam National University- Hanoi University of Science and I have studied in VNU for 2 years in Mathematics major. Realizing that I do not like to study Mathematics as I thought. Therefore, after a short time relaxes and found a new interest major, I have changed to study in RMIT since July 2019. I can speak Vietnamese as my local language and English. As every younger in Vietnamese, I love to spend time playing video games and I spent all my free time to play Dota2 with my friend, I also enjoy watching movies especially in scary movies. My favorite movie right now is Scary Stories to tell in the Dark.  </p>


<h2 id="myHeader" style="font-size: 35px;"> My Interest in IT</h2>

     <p>I have my first PC when I was 5, so I was approached to a computer from very early. But for the first time, all my views with a computer just no more than a machine for playing video games. I love to play videogame from I was a child, in that time, my dream was making a game that everyone loves to play, this is one of my reasons for choosing IT as my major. Next, I started to search for information about IT and find out that IT is more than just about a video game. IT appears in all parts of human life: business, architecture, traffic, entertainment, etc. Then, the more information I knew in IT, the more interesting in this major increased. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIwLWfaAg-8&t=404s"> The talk show of Elon Musk in TED </a>  about The future we’re building is the last factor that helps me to choose this major. He is a good example of successful people from technology majors, then the Imagine he draws about what technology can improve people's lives in the future make me excited and want to be an IT worker. </p>

<h2 id="myHeader" style="font-size: 35px;"> Reasons why I choose RMIT Vietnam:</h2>


     <ul>
       <li>	The first reason I choose to study in RMIT Vietnam is because of RMIT's global well-known fame. RMIT is a famous international university that has a high world ranking ( <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/rmit-university">#223 QS Global World Ranking – Top University</a>). Moreover, students enrolled at RMIT University Vietnam study and graduate with the same programs and degree from RMIT in Melbourne. Then, RMIT Vietnam is the best choice for students like me who want to study at a global university without moving aboard.</li>
       <li>  The education programs in RMIT Vietnam are updated annually to ensure that the program is not out of date. That’s so important for students to have reality knowledge and skill to ready entering the workplace in future especially student study IT.</li>

     <p> The results of these tests have a critical meaning for me. These ideas help me more understand about myself:  who I am, my weakness and my strength. Furthermore, I can know my best way of learning through the learning style test. Moreover, the results support me in choosing IT as my job by showing that I have enough abilities to work in an IT major. I always wonder if I choose the right job and do me suitable to be an IT worker.  A big fear appears insight me that I cannot go far from this way because I don’t have any talent. The results of these tests bellow show to me that I am suitable to work in the job I love with creativity and inventiveness. </p>

     <p> I believe these results will influence my behavior a lot while working in a team. I will try to do all my strengths and improve my weakness. For instance, the IT industry requires all employees have to work as a team, so people who are passive and selfish are hard to work in this major. By knowing I am introverted, I will try to be sociable, active to talk and be confident to show my idea with other members of a team. I will make a decision based on notice thinking more than just a feeling. I will be an enthusiastic teammate who will help other members.  </p>

     <p> From these results I got from these test, right now while forming in a team I believe that I can become a good listener and a good member who usually give ideas for solving problems. </p>

<h2 id="myHeader" style="font-size: 35px;"> My Project idea</h2>

      <b>Overview </b>

      <p>My project idea is a cloud app work as a huge library include a hundred of apps that will help users can use other apps and programs without installing in their computer. This app can run on many devices such as in a computer, a tablet, a smartphone, a smart Television or even a Gameboy. People can use the apps just by several clicks on the screen and they do not need to worry about system requirements of products or the capacity of their computer. Basically, this app can help their users break the limit of hardware and freely enjoy technology.</p>
      <b>Motivation </b>

      <p>Nowadays, a system requirement is a huge problem for many people. Many apps ask their users to have a strong computer and special devices for use. Therefore, people must invest must money for their computer and buy other devices for working and entertaining. In my opinion, the hardware is the factor that defends people from using apps, so we need to find a way to solve this problem. Then, my idea comes up when I was watching a movie on Netflix and I thought that streaming service might be the best solution. Just in a few years, Netflix changes people’s habits from hiring CD, DVD to watch movie online from their devices. I believe that we can do the same thing with apps. </p>

      <b>Description </b>

      <p>This app requires nothing for their users but the strong and stable internet, I will explant some information and the way the app works. Firstly, I want to talk a little bit information about the app display, the apps will be work as a library of apps, all the apps will be a group in the major and their functions such as System- Security, Office, Multi-Media, Programming-Design, Applicable Software, Game and, Movie. Every product in this library will have a small box chat for users to evaluate and comment on their product. This app also has a ranking for products in each major. Furthermore, this app will have a tutorial for newbie and a 24/7 support system to answer and support users. Moreover, not only English this app will also support to translating to other languages. Basically, my app will work as a streaming video, while people use the app for example, they use my app to use Adobe Premiere. They have to find Adobe Premiere in Programming- Design group, then they will be moved to the working display screen. This app will be received all activities that users do in their devices in the working display screen and give feedback for the main server. Then, the main server will give that actions to another computer that have Adobe Premiere and do all the actions that user do in their devices. Then, the information from this computer will give to the main server and give feedback for the users’ devices. To be clearer, the users will work with another computer that has Adobe Premiere, their devices just play the role as a screen and receiving user’s interaction.  </p>

      <b>Tools and Technologies  </b>

      <p>The first step to make this app I have to create a big cloud database server that can store the information of users and their feedback – playing a role as cloud infrastructure. Then, I need to have a huge number of strong computers or a supercomputer for carrying out a hundred of apps for users. Moreover, I have to write programming to transfer information to the server. Therefore, this is also needed an agreement from many technology companies to allow their products in my app. </p>

      <b>Skills Required</b>

      <p>To build this app, I must have a huge range of knowledge of cloud computing and its service. Furthermore, it is needed to know programming languages relative to cloud computing such as Python, Java, ASP.NET, PHP and RUBY. </p>

      <b>Outcome </b>

      <p>I believe that this app is helpful for low-quality computer’s users and people who want to try many apps. If the app is successful, people can work in everywhere and on every device they want. They don’t need to worry about if this app suitable for their device or their device strong enough to run it, the only thing they have to give attention is the internet. Furthermore, I believe that my app can change the habit of customers while they buy a new device.  They don’t need to buy a powerful computer for their work and a console device for their entertainment, all they need just an app can connect every app they want. Many ideas and projects in cloud service are failed in the past because of the limit of internet speed. But nowadays with the outstanding development of the internet speed, to be more specific 5G internet, I believe this is a favorable time for the cloud services like my app. </p>
